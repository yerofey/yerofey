## üëã Hey, I'm Erofei

I'm a Full Stack Engineer passionate about building thoughtful, secure, and scalable web applications. Whether it's a social network, crypto wallet tool, or encrypted note-sharing service, I love crafting software that feels clean, purposeful, and empowering.

### üíª What I Do

I‚Äôve worked across the stack with:
- **Node.js**, **Nuxt.js (Vue.js)**, **Next.js (React.js)**, and **PHP/Laravel**
- **Cloud deployments** on **AWS**, **Vercel**, **Cloudflare (Workers, Pages, KV, Durable Objects)**, and **IBM Cloud**
- **CI/CD**, **Docker**, and automated systems for background jobs and infrastructure
- **RESTful APIs**, real-time chat, webhook-based services, and crypto integrations

I enjoy both backend logic and frontend UX, always with a focus on modular design and performance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Side Projects

- [**comment-by-ai (cba)**](https://github.com/yerofey/comment-by-ai) ‚Äî a command-line tool to generate git commit messages using any AI model (via OpenRouter API).
- [**cryptowallet-cli (cw)**](https://github.com/yerofey/cryptowallet-cli) ‚Äî a command-line tool to generate cryptocurrency wallets with custom prefixes/suffixes. It supports multiple chains and works offline.
- [**secred.link**](https://secred.link) ‚Äî a privacy-first secret note service. Notes are encrypted in the browser, and the decryption key never touches the server ([frontend](https://github.com/yerofey/secred.link), [backend](https://github.com/yerofey/api.secred.link)).
- [**timed.cc**](https://timed.cc) ‚Äî a minimal cross-device sharing tool that lets you generate short-lived codes to open links on any device without login ([frontend](https://github.com/yerofey/timed.cc), [backend](https://github.com/yerofey/api.timed.cc)).
- And several ongoing experiments in automation, real-time applications and Web3 ([example](https://testnet.secred.app)).
