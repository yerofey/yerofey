## 👋 Hey, I'm Erofei

I'm a Full Stack Engineer passionate about building thoughtful, secure, and scalable web applications. Whether it's a social network, crypto wallet tool, or encrypted note-sharing service, I love crafting software that feels clean, purposeful, and empowering.

### 💻 What I Do

I’ve worked across the stack with:
- **Node.js**, **Nuxt.js (Vue)**, **Next.js (React)**, and **PHP/Laravel**
- **Cloud deployments** on AWS, IBM Cloud, Vercel, and Cloudflare
- **CI/CD**, **Docker**, and automated systems for background jobs and infrastructure
- **RESTful APIs**, real-time chat, webhook-based services, and crypto integrations

I enjoy both backend logic and frontend UX, always with a focus on modular design and performance.

### ⚙️ Side Projects

- [**cryptowallet-cli (CW)**](https://github.com/yerofey/cryptowallet-cli) — a command-line tool to generate cryptocurrency wallets with custom prefixes/suffixes. It supports multiple chains and works offline.
- [**secred.link**](https://github.com/yerofey/secred.link) — a privacy-first secret note service. Notes are encrypted in the browser, and the decryption key never touches the server (shared via `#` in the link).
- And several ongoing experiments in automation, Web3, and real-time systems.

### 🧠 My Background

With a degree in Psychology, I bring a user-first mindset to development—focusing on intuitive UX, accessibility, and the small details that make tools enjoyable to use. I'm especially excited about privacy tech, crypto, and AI-driven automation.
